Link for the data set, that i have used:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG
========================

The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon(mpg) 

 	// Actually mpg depends on several variables, but I have simplified for myself 
 	// the task and I have done the simple linear regression where mpg depends on 		
 	// other arguments separately
