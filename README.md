simple-linear-regression
========================

The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon(mpg) 

====================
		 		// Actually mpg depends on several variables, but I have simplified for myself 
		 		// the task and I have done the simple linear regression where mpg depends on 		
		 		// other arguments separately
